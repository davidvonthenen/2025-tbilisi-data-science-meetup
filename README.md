# Tbilisi Data Science Meetup 2025: Unlocking RAG's Potential: MCP and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Action

Welcome to the landing page for the workshop `Unlocking RAG's Potential: MCP and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Action` at the `Tbilisi Data Science Meetup 2025`.

## What to Expect

This workshop intends to provide an introduction to:

- Introduction to using [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) to connect multiple agents together
- Introduction to using [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) to use with an AI Agent
- How to Build an Alternative to a RAG Agent That Provides Similar Functionality
- How To Connect This Agent With a Traditional RAG Agent (Using OpenSearch)

All of this using Small Language Models (SLM) which require less resources at inference time.

## Software Prerequisites

- A Linux or Mac-based Developer’s Laptop with enough memory to run a database (ie OpenSearch) plus Intel's neural-chat SLM (below).
  - Windows Users should use a VM or Cloud Instance
- Python Installed: version 3.12 or higher
- (Recommended) Using a miniconda or venv virtual environment
- Docker (Linux or MacOS) Installed: for running a local OpenSearch instance
- Basic familiarity with shell operations

Docker images you should pre-pull in your environment:

- `docker image pull opensearchproject/opensearch:3`
